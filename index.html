							<h2>Important Issues</h2>
							<p>The next few years will be an amazing journey for privacy, sustainability, and what it means to be a human in a digital first world. ZCash has the potential to change the future of the way people fundamentally interact with each other in real world and as we step into web3. The ZOMG is uniquely positioned to fund real contributions to this project and shape its future. This responsibility is not something I take lightly.</p>

									<h3>Privacy</h3>
									<p>Privacy is a fundimentally human right. This right must be protected as we enter new frontiers of human interacetion and commerce. I belive that the work being done in ZCASH as a technology and as a community movement are radically reimagining what is possible in this space and are for the greatest good of all projects.</p>

									<h3>Sustainability</h3>
									<p>A peer to peer network must be sustainable long term. Decisions made today will have long term implecations on this technology and its footprint for decades to come. Ensuring sustainability will be consided across all aspects of the stack is of utmost importance to the community and the future users of zcash.   </p>

									<h3>Digital Rights </h3>
									<p>The events of the last few years have changed the relationship with work and technology. We have the technology to empower a global workforce that can shape their own destiny and we are no longer bound by geography when delivering value. Ensuring that human rights and digital rights are fundimentally guaranteed is paramount to all workers in the technology revolution. </p>

								<h2>Why Cody for the ZOMG?</h2>
							</header>

							<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>Professionally, I am an enterprise blockchain architect at a professional technology consulting firm and I focus on multi-party systems, conversational AI, digital Identity, and work on implementing zero-knowledge systems at scale. I have worked with distributed systems since the early 2000‚Äôs in the US military(leaving government service in 2009) and have worked publicly with ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù since ~2014. I am currently a board member of the Ethereum Classic cooperative and participating member of the Ethereum Enterprise alliance.</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>	My motivation for candidacy in the ZOMG is to advance projects which are legitimate in business purpose, technical aptitude, and are an advancement to the Zcash ecosystem. I am familiar with the needs and requirements of enterprise blockchain and security considerations. I understand that this is not a position to be entered for personal recognition or reward and promise to discharge the duties of the position with fairness, openness, and at the pleasure of the community. Zcash has been at the bleeding edge of distributed systems funding and I hope, by my participation, I am able to help advance this global social experiment.</p>
