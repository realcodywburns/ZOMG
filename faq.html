                                    <h3>ZOMG announcement attracts 100s of applicants from all over the world with all random ideas, all matching your goals, how would you evaluate them?</h3>
                                    <p>I hope there are more than 100s. Generally speaking, ideas are easy when compared to execution, which is much harder. Evaluating the team is as important as the ideas. The ZOMG funds are not free money for trying something out. Projects will need to have a plan and the ability to execute. Every project doesn‚Äôt have to be amazing, or innovative but it should provide value to zcash and not just the developers</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>What locals, regions, languages, ethnicities, educational backgrounds of people have you worked with? What are your preferences of assembling teams that deliver?</h3>
                                    <p>I work with global teams daily. Diverse groups allow projects to be more human imho. Everyones backgrounds and experiences shape how they view the world and influences how they think and reason.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>We live in a remote world now, how do you evaluate applicants for grants?</h3>
                                    <p>Grant applicants should expect to provide frequent updates throughout the process and continue as long as they receive funding. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù work is work, same expectations.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Projects in Zcash are going to go through a huge change beyond the handful, driven teams funded via Zcash Foundation, thoughts?</h3>
                                    <p>If the only thing driving zcash is the foundation then the ecosystem would be unsustainable long term. Zcash needs to be approachable to all developers and communities and out grow its current system of governance. The ultimate goal of the ZOMG should be to be so successful it puts itself out of business because there are many self funded projects, community groups, and fans that zec has a life all its own.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Zcash is a protocol at its core, ZEC price is volatile. How will you handle a single digit ZEC? ($9 x 8640/month = $77,760) How will you handle a 5 digit ZEC? ($21,000 x 8640/month = $181.44MM)</h3>
                                    <p>Hopefully the answer in either case is ‚Äúwith grace‚Äù. I love zcash and its goals so the price doesn‚Äôt effect my personal motivations. Its my hope projects have the foresite to plan for both possibilities and the ZOMG can value the zec granted out with both situations in mind.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Could you give your thoughts on what you think should be done regarding dev funding after the 4 years of the major grants committee? Should it be continued after the 2nd halvening (year 8), or be discontinued in favor of something else?</h3>
                                    <p>I would like to see a more decentralized process on the future. We are starting to see maturity of solutions in the wild like the Bisq dao as an example that is on chain and distrubuted. In 4 years time, and possibly with grants from the MGRC, the community and ecosystem can be in a place where bolt is working, shielded coloured coins and scripts are working, shielded transactions are the norm, and hardware wallets can support signing signatures. These things can be leveraged to create a solution that allows the less zealot to participate and have their opinions heard.</p>
                                    <p>I would say the default should be the MGRC should expect to last only the 4 years, however, there should be periodic checkpoints with the community. If the MGRC is lightning in a bottle and is going tremendous work for the community, arbitrarily stopping it and defunding grantees work should be avoided. Open transport operations are a must. Constant feedback is a must. The more engaged the user base are the better both systems will work</p>
									
                                    <h3>I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of the reputation enterprise blockchains and consultancy has in this space (including probably coining that phrase). I noticed you have a background in that. What do you think that brings as an asset and what as a liability?</h3>
									<p>I have been on both sides of the fence for quite some time now. I started in the public space and then was lucky enough to get a job working on enterprise, so my heart is still very much in the public side. I dont think many enterprise blockchain applications need the public chains, or most even blockchain at all. For enterprise, I work in multi party systems. Distrubuted compute, storage, and state are all very much in demand in large part to the popularity of crypto. The systems I help build do too much traffic with limited value to anyone outside of a legal agreement to need a public chain. Dealing with inter-company politics and solving carbon based problems is 85% of what I do.</p>
                                    <p>There are true legitimate use cases for public chains and zcash is a great example of providing the public with a needed resource (zec) and a fundamental right (privacy). Z2z messages can provide a universal encrypted messaging platform. Zksnarks, starks, snorks and every other exciting advancement in cryptography are all coming from, broadly this community.</p>
                                    <p>The popularity of crypto has also brought in the usual lot of nefarious actors. They are the ones that know niche tech well enough to spew buzz words to get funding without any intent to deliver or are just looking for funding for an unrelated startup. I spend my days and nights researching emerging tech and its business applications for business and mankind, I like to think this gives me a reasonable understanding of projects requirements and outcomes. Grants should be for research and projects that both benefit zcash and the public good. I think helping draw the line between the two types is the ZOMG.</p>
