									<h3>ZCG announcement attracts 100s of applicants from all over the world with all random ideas, all matching your goals, how would you evaluate them?</h3>
                                    <p>I hope there are more than 100s. Ideas are easy when compared to execution, which is much harder. Evaluating the team is as important as the ideas. The ZCG funds are not free money for trying something out. Projects will need to have a plan and the ability to execute. Every project doesn‚Äôt have to be amazing, or innovative but it should provide value to zcash and not just the developers</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>What locals, regions, languages, ethnicities, educational backgrounds of people have you worked with? What are your preferences of assembling teams that deliver? </h3>
                                    <p>I work with global teams daily. Diverse groups allow projects to be more human imho. Everyone‚Äôs backgrounds and experiences shape how they view the world and influences how they think and reason.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>We live in a remote world now, how do you evaluate applicants for grants?</h3>
                                    <p>Grant applicants should expect to provide frequent updates throughout the process and continue if they receive funding. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù work is work, same expectations.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Projects in Zcash are going to go through a huge change beyond the handful, driven teams funded via Zcash Foundation, thoughts?</h3>
                                    <p>If the only thing driving zcash is the foundation then the ecosystem would be unsustainable long term. Zcash needs to be approachable to all developers and communities and out grow its current system of governance. The ultimate goal of the ZCG should be to be so successful it puts itself out of business because there are many self funded projects, community groups, and fans that zec has a life all its own.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Zcash is a protocol at its core, ZEC price is volatile. How will you handle a single digit ZEC? ($9 x 8640/month = $77,760) How will you handle a 5 digit ZEC? ($21,000 x 8640/month = $181.44MM)</h3>
                                    <p>Hopefully the answer in either case is ‚Äúwith grace‚Äù. I love zcash and its goals so the price doesn‚Äôt effect my personal motivations. It‚Äôs my hope projects have the foresight to plan for both possibilities and the ZCG can value the zec granted out with both situations in mind.</p>
